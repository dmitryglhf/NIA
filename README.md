# NIA Framework 


*An elegant, modular, and scalable solution for automated machine learning tasks.*

---


## 📖 Overview 
The **AutoML Framework**  is a comprehensive toolkit designed to automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline. From data preprocessing and feature engineering to model selection and hyperparameter tuning, this framework simplifies the complexities of machine learning development.
Whether you're a data scientist, an engineer, or a researcher, this framework offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to accelerate your machine learning workflows.


---


## 🛠️ Features 
 
- **Automated Data Preprocessing** : Handles missing data, encoding, scaling, and more.
 
- **Feature Engineering** : Automated feature selection and extraction.
 
- **Model Search & Selection** : Integrates with popular ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
 
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** : Built-in support for grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
 
- **Customizable Pipelines** : Modular design allows for tailored pipelines for specific use cases.
 
- **Extensible** : Easy to integrate new models, techniques, and workflows.

## 🚀 Getting Started 

### Prerequisites 

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+

- pip or conda package manager

- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation 
 
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automl-framework.git
```
 
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd automl-framework
```
 
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start 
 
1. Import the framework:

```python
from automl_framework import AutoML
```
 
2. Initialize and run the AutoML pipeline:

```python
automl = AutoML(config="default_config.yaml")
automl.run(data="path/to/dataset.csv")
```
 
3. View results:

```python
automl.get_summary()
```
